# Privacy Policy for Ghostbuster

**Effective Date:** October 1, 2025

Thank you for playing Ghostbuster ("the app"). This privacy policy explains what information is handled by the app and why.

### Data Collection and Usage

We believe in privacy. Ghostbuster is designed to be a completely self-contained, offline experience.

**The app does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.**

We do not collect information such as your name, email address, location, device ID, or any other data that could be used to identify you. The game does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

### Locally Stored Data (High Scores)

The only data the app saves is your high score history. This information is stored **exclusively on your own device** using the browser's local storage functionality.

This data is never transmitted to us or any third party. It remains on your device and can be cleared by you at any time by clearing your browser's site data. Its sole purpose is to allow you to track your own progress and best scores within the game.

### Children's Privacy

Since the app does not collect any personal information whatsoever, it is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
